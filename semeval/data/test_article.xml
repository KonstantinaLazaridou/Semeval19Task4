<article id="0000001" published-at="2017-09-10" title="After DeVos Announced Plans To Reexamine Title IX, Texas Attorney Tweets He Would 'Be Ok If [She] Was Sexually Assaulted'"><p>When explaining her decision to reevaluate Title IX guidelines as they pertain to sexual assault on college campuses, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/betsy-devos-overhaul-obama-era-guidance-campus-sex-assault-n799471" type="external">said</a>: ?Every survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously. Every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.?</p> 
<p>The Obama administration?s changes to Title IX have been <a href="" type="internal">criticized</a> for, among other things, substantially lowering the burden of proof as it pertains to sexual assault, as well as denying elements of due process to the accused.</p> 
<p>However, many progressives are lashing out at DeVos because they hate her, and also rape culture and stuff.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most grotesque attack came when Rob Ranco, a Texas attorney, tweeted Friday that ?I'm not wishing for it ? but I'd be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted. #Sexual Assault #TitleIX.?</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/9/rob-ranco-texas-lawyer-says-he-would-be-ok-if-bets/" type="external">The Washington Times</a> reports that in several other tweets (condensed for this publication), Ranco wrote: ?Perhaps Betsy doesn?t understand how horrible rape is. She?s made the world more dangerous for my daughters. I need her to understand,? and ?Make the world more dangerous for my daughters ? intentionally ? and your well being is not my concern. Full stop.?</p> 
<p>Ranco's additional tweets don't make his first one any less vile.</p> 
<p>In the wake of the overwhelming negative response, Ranco locked his Twitter profile, then <a href="https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2017/09/09/cowardly-austin-lawyer-wished-sexual-assault-betsy-devos-locked-twitter-account/" type="external">deleted</a> it.</p> 
<p>Many on social media are calling for the attorney to be fired from The Carlson Law Firm, where he is a partner, or even disbarred:</p> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet" type="external">@PrisonPlanet</a> I'm wishing for it... but I'd be ok if <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobRanco?src=hash" type="external">#RobRanco</a> was disbarred.</p> 
<p>As of this publication, the law firm?s Twitter account has also been locked, though Ranco is still listed on the official website?s ? <a href="https://www.carlsonattorneys.com/team-member/robert-ranco/" type="external">Team</a>? section.</p>

<article id="0000002" published-at="2017-05-05" title="University To Award Trayvon Martin With Posthumous Degree In Aviation"><p>A Florida university will honor Trayvon Martin with a posthumous Bachelor of Science Degree in Aviation at a May 13 commencement ceremony. The degree will be accepted by his parents, Tracy Martin and Sabrina Fulton.</p> 
<p>Seventeen-year-old Martin was killed in February of 2012 by former neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, in self-defense. After a long, racially-charged public debate and court trial, Zimmerman was completely exonerated in July of 2013.</p> 
<p>Florida Memorial University officially <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FLMemorialUniv/" type="external">announced</a>the posthumous degree via Facebook on Wednesday.</p> 
<p>"The University will confer upon TRAYVON MARTIN a posthumous degree in Aeronautical Science with a concentration in Flight Education, in honor of the steps he took during his young life toward becoming a pilot," says the Facebook post. "This particular Bachelor?s degree is designated for those studying to be pilots. Martin?s parents, both social justice activists and co-founders of The Trayvon Martin Foundation ... will accept the degree on behalf of their son."</p> 
<p>?Of special significance is awarding posthumously the Bachelor of Science Degree in Aviation to Trayvon Martin. Sybrina, our alum, epitomizes strength and dignity as she uplifts other victims of violence while effecting change for a more equal and just society," said Florida Memorial University President Dr. Roslyn Clark Artis.</p> 
<p>Additionally, the school will host a post-commencement fundraiser which will partly support The Trayvon Martin Foundation.</p></article>
